HOLD FOR UPADTING CURRENT RESEARCH

::: {#ppc}
I have developed a research program focused on studies of coral reef ecology, seagrass ecology, species interactions, and larval recruitment in the face of anthropogenically induced sedimentation, eutrophication and ocean acidification. Recently, I have become interested in how climate change and ocean acidification will influence biogenic habitat engineers and subsequently habitat complexity, and how these changes will cascade throughout the ecosystem.
