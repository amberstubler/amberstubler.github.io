It will cover fishes, invertebrates, mammals, reptiles, and algae. Included will be an investigation of behavior, ecology, adaptations, and environmental relationships to humans. An emphasis will be placed on forms common to California.\n\n\nPrevious Experience\nMAR 105: INTRODUCTION TO OCEANOGRAPHY (Fall and Spring 2015), Suffolk County Community College\nThis course focused on life in the oceans against a background of its interaction with the physical, chemical and geological environment. Lectures, laboratory and field trips are employed to explore fundamental properties which underlie oceanic phenomena.\n\nMAR 388: TROPICAL MARINE ECOLOGY (January 2009-2014), Stony Brook University\nThis travel course to the Discovery Bay Marine Lab in Jamaica is designed to literally immerse students in marine ecology. The course consists of formal lectures, demonstrations and instructor-led field trips and involves snorkeling, SCUBA diving, and underwater photography. Students develop individual research projects requiring field observations and collecting data and write a research proposal and final research papers.\n\nWISE 187: WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (Introduction to Research; Spring 2011), Stony Brook University\nAn introduction to and hands-on experience in doing research in mathematics, engineering, and several science disciplines within a group setting. The students rotate among several research environments: computer science, mathematics, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. Within each environment they are given background readings, instructed in the problem to be studied, jointly carry out a small experiment related to the problem, and discuss the social implications of the research problem. Students make presentations related to one of the projects in which they participate. Enrollment limited to first-year women in the WISE program.\n\nOCEANOGRAPHY; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION UNIT, Southampton High School (Spring 2014)\nGuest lecturer for the ocean acidification unit at a local high school; created a two-week unit exploring acidification using a series of lab experiments and reading assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nMentoring Experience\nGraduate Committee Member:\nEmily Fox, MS candidate\n\nHonors Thesis Advisor:\nAlyssa Stevens\n\nUndergraduate Research Mentor:\nJamie Gay\nSarah White\nKaitlyn O’Toole\nTracey Vlasak\nMichelle Lewis\nGraceAnne Taylor\nBrooke Morrell\nPaulina Miczko\n\nHigh School Research Mentor:\nTimothy Squires"
