Welcome to the Stubler Lab at [Occidental College](https://www.oxy.edu/) in Los Angeles, CA!

Our lab studies how anthropogenic impacts affect marine ecosystems. Our current research interest include investigating the effect of climate change on benthic communities and in particular sponge, coral reef, seagrass, and kelp ecosystems. We use a variety of methods including research aquariums and field based experiments

We invite you to explore the website to learn more about our work and lab.
