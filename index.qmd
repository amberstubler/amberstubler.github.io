Hello! I am a Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at [Occidental College](https://www.oxy.edu/) in Los Angeles, CA

As a researcher with broad interests in how anthropogenic impacts affect marine ecosystems, I have developed a research program focused on studies of coral reef ecology, seagrass ecology, species interactions, and larval recruitment in the face of anthropogenically induced sedimentation, eutrophication and ocean acidification. Recently, I have become interested in how climate change and ocean acidification will influence biogenic habitat engineers and subsequently habitat complexity, and how these changes will cascade throughout the ecosystem.
